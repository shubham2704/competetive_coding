Given some positive integers, I wish to print the integers such that all take up the same width by adding a minimum number of leading zeroes. No leading zeroes shall be added to the largest integer.

For example, given 1, 23, 2, 17, 102, I wish to print out these numbers as follows:

001
023
002
017
102
