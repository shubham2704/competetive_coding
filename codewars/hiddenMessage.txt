You are a great investigator. You are spending Christmas holidays with your family when you receive a series of postcards.
At first glance the text on the postcards doesn't make sense (why send random quotes?), but after a closer look you notice something strange.

Maybe there is a hidden message!

Technical details
Your task is to create a class Investigator with at least these two methods:

postcard(self, text) - analyzes text (a string); return value doesn't matter.
hidden_message(self) - returns the hidden message (a string).
Typical usage:

investigator = Investigator()
investigator.postcard(text of first postcard)
investigator.postcard(text of second postcard)
investigator.postcard(...)
investigator.postcard(text of last postcard)
investigator.hidden_message()  # return value is checked
# investigator goes out of scope
1-15 postcards per instance
one hidden message per instance
