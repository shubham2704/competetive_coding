A special type of prime is generated by the formula p = 2^m * 3^n + 1 where m and n can be any non-negative integer.

The first 5 of these primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, and are generated as follows:

2 = 2^0 * 3^0 + 1
3 = 2^1 * 3^0 + 1
5 = 2^2 * 3^0 + 1
7 = 2^1 * 3^1 + 1
13 = 2^2 * 3^1 + 1
..and so on
You will be given a range and your task is to return the number of primes that have this property. For example, solve(0,15) = 5, because there are only 5 such primes >= 0 and < 15; they are 2,3,5,7,13. The upper limit of the tests will not exceed 1,500,000.

More examples in the test cases.

Good luck!
