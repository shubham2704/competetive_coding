In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients expressed with formula

(nk)=n!k!(n−k)!\lparen {n \atop k} \rparen = \frac {n!} {k!(n-k)!}( 
k
n
​	
 )= 
k!(n−k)!
n!
​	
 
where n denotes a row of the triangle, and k is a position of a term in the row.

Task
Write a function that, given a depth n, returns n top rows of Pascal's Triangle flattened into a one-dimensional list/array.

Example:
n = 1: [1]
n = 2: [1,  1, 1]
n = 4: [1,  1, 1,  1, 2, 1,  1, 3, 3, 1]
