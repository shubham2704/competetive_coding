Codewars Bar recommends you drink 1 glass of water per standard drink so you're not hungover tomorrow morning.

Your fellow coders have bought you several drinks tonight in the form of a string. Return a string suggesting how many glasses of water you should drink to not be hungover.

Examples
"1 beer"  -->  "1 glass of water"
because you drank one standard drink

"1 shot, 5 beers, 2 shots, 1 glass of wine, 1 beer"  -->  "10 glasses of water"
because you drank ten standard drinks
Note:

To keep the things simple, we'll consider that any "numbered thing" in the string is a drink. Even "1 bear" -> "1 glass of water"; or "1 chainsaw and 2 pools" -> "3 glasses of water"...
